%   cascade, in MW)
% 
%   slackchange: struct with field TOTAL (changes in the total power output
%   of the slack busses)
% 
%   origin: ntrigger-by-1 vector, the indices of the initial triggers
%   (i.e., the initial line failures)
%

%   (including the initial failures)

%   proctime: the time separation between two consecutive failures, it has
%   the same length as process and the first
